I am a Senior Research Associate at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR), UNSW Business School, where I investigates continuous-time stochastic mortality models and their applications to actuarial valuation.

My research interests lie within the field of financial and actuarial mathematics, primarily on the applications of probability theory and stochastic analysis to tackle financial and actuarial problems (e.g. financial or insurance risk modelling and management, asset price modelling, term structure modelling, pricing and hedging financial derivatives) and the development of numerical and statistical methods to solve these problems.

I obtained my PhD from the University of South Australia in 2021. My PhD research focused on the use of stochastic volatility and jump-diffusion models and formulating correspoding numerical methods for option pricing.
