The UNSW School of Risk and Actuarial Studies hosted the UNSW Risk and Actuarial Industry Workshop on 6-7 December 2021. The online workshop attracted more than 110 registrants and brought together industry experts and leading academics to discuss current and emerging topics in risk, actuarial science, and data analytics.

The aim of the workshop was to create networks and opportunities for further collaboration between industry and academia in research, education, and social engagement opportunities. The workshop followed the 29th Colloquium in Pensions and Retirement Research on 1-3 December 2021, also co-hosted by the School of Risk and Actuarial Studies.
